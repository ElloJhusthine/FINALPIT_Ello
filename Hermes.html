            <h2>Hermes</h2>
            <h3>God of travel, gambling, messaging, invention, sleep, speed, and thievery</h3>
            <p>Hermes was one of only a few Greek gods that could travel freely between the different realms. As messenger to the gods, he was responsible for delivering messages to and fro between the mortal and divine worlds, and he was able to do this thanks to his winged sandals.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="container">
            <img src="Hermes.webp" alt="Hermes ">
            <p>In Greek mythology, one of the Olympian gods, son of Zeus and Maia, and possessor of several attributes. A very old deity, he was already worshipped in pre-Greek ancient history possibly as a god of fertility, of flocks, of magic, of divination, of roads and trips, among other attributes.</p>
            <p>Over the centuries his myth was extensively expanded, becoming the messenger of the gods and patron of gymnastics, thieves, diplomats, merchants, astronomy, eloquence and some forms of initiation, besides being the guide of the souls of the dead to the realm of Hades, just to name a few of his best known functions.</p>
            <p>With the domination of Greece by Rome, Hermes was assimilated to the god Mercury, and through the Egyptian influence, he also suffered a syncretism with Tot, giving rise to the character of Hermes Trismegistus.</p>
            <p>Both assimilations had great importance, creating a rich tradition and perpetuating his image throughout the centuries until contemporary times, exerting significant influence on the culture of the West and of certain eastern areas around the Mediterranean, reaching as far as Persia and Arabia.</p>
            <p>The first literary descriptions about Hermes date from the Archaic period in Greece, and show him being born in Arcadia. Already on the first day of his life he performed several feats and displayed various powers: he stole fifty cows from his brother Apollo, invented fire, sacrifices, magic sandals, and the lyre.</p>
            <p>The next day, forgiven for stealing the cows, he was invested with additional powers by Apollo and his father Zeus, and in turn granted Apollo the art of new music, and was admitted to Olympus as one of the great gods.</p>
            <p>Later numerous other writers expanded and embellished his original story, even making him a demiurge, and multiple versions of it appeared, not infrequently diverging in various details, while preserving its most characteristic lines. He was one of the most popular gods of classical antiquity, had many loves and fathered numerous offspring.</p>
            <p>With the advent of Christianity, he came to be compared to Christ in his role as interpreter of the will of the Logos. The figures of Hermes and his main badge, the caduceus, are still known and used today for their symbolic value, and several authors consider him the tutelary image of contemporary Western culture.</p>

            <img src="Hermes1.jpg.crdownload" alt="Hermes ">
            <p>A trickster from birth, one of his most enduring myths concerned the theft of his brother Apollo's cattle. </p>
            <p>According to one story, when Hermes was only a few hours old, he stole cattle from the god Apollo. Zeus told Hermes to give the cattle back. Instead, Hermes played a stringed instrument called a lyre, which he had invented. Apollo loved his playing so much that he let Hermes keep the cattle in exchange for the lyre.</p>
