            <h1>Ιαπετός</h1>
            <h2>Iapetus</h2>
            <h3>Lord of the Underworld and Titan of the West</h3>
            <p>Cutting and Restoring Mortal Life - His main power and domain, Iapetus can cut short the lives of mortals or bring mortals back to life. Although he rarely chooses to do the latter.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="container">
            <img src="Iapetus.webp" alt="Iapetus">
            <p>An Elder Titan born after Oceanus and Hyperion, He and three of his brothers were posted at the four corners of the world (Iapetus was in the West) where they seized hold of Ouranos and held him fast, while Kronos, hidden in the center, wounding him with his power. Iapetus' position as a pillar of the West was later taken up by his son, Atlas.</p>
            <p>Iapetus was the former emperor of the Underworld, and was cast into Tartarus after the war along with his brothers but due to his former lordship of the underworld broke himself free, hades later left him to help govern the underworld using him as his top enforcer. Being the Titan of Mortal-Life (or rather the mortal life span), his sons Prometheus and Epimetheus were represented as the creators of man emotions and other mortal creatures. His last son, Menoetius, was the Titan of Rash Action.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="container">
            <img src="Iapetus1.webp" alt="Iapetus ">
            <p>A trickster from birth, one of his most enduring myths concerned the theft of his brother Apollo's cattle. </p>
            <p>According to one story, when Hermes was only a few hours old, he stole cattle from the god Apollo. Zeus told Hermes to give the cattle back. Instead, Hermes played a stringed instrument called a lyre, which he had invented. Apollo loved his playing so much that he let Hermes keep the cattle in exchange for the lyre.</p>
            <p>Iapetus is one of Cronus older brothers, who stood at the Western edge of the world and held onto their father Oranos as Cronus wounded him. Together with Klymene he fathered Prometheus, Atlas, Epimetheus, and Menoetius. This makes him the spiritual father of mortality, although Iapetus never got to see his metaphorical grandchildren as he was defeated during the Titanomachy and sealed in Tartarus, with Atlas taking his place as supporter of the sky from the West.</p>

        <h1><u>POWERS</u></h1>
        <h2>Cutting and Restoring Mortal Life</h2>
        <p>His main power and domain, Iapetus can cut short the lives of mortals or bring mortals back to life. Although he rarely chooses to do the latter.</p>
        <h2>Fear</h2>
        <p>Unlike Hades, it is not the Terror of death that follows Iapetus around, just the Inevitability of it. It tends to crush the soul rather than frighten it. </p>
        <h2>Lord of the West </h2>
        <p>Because Iapetus has the capability to restore mortal life, as well as the fact that LA is in his domain (City on the West Coast of the Western Hemisphere), he has the tendency to be very persuasive to mortals, able to gather a large cult-like following (if he can hold back on terrifying them, that is). He also becomes much stronger the closer he gets to the exact center of the Western hemisphere, at that one point being even stronger than his son Atlas, and has the capability to dominate younger directional forces (such as Zephyr, the West Wind).</p>
