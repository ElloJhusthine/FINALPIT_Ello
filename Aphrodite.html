            <h1>Αφροδίτη</h1>
                <h2>Aphrodite</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="container">
            <img src="Aphrodite.png" alt="Aphrodite">
            <p>Aphrodite has the power of love, in all of its positive and negative connotations. Her magic girdle can cause anyone to desire and love the wearer. Her beauty can make people love her and fight over her.</p>
          </div>
    <div id="container">
        <img src="Aphrodite1.webp" alt="Aphrodite ">
        <p>In Greek mythology, the most famous version of her birth told by Hesiod, she was born when Kronos cut off the genitals of Uranus and threw them into the sea; out of the foam (aphros) that arose Aphrodite rose. However for Homer, prior to Hesiod, she was the daughter of Zeus and Dione.</p>
        <p>The main myths involving the goddess are the Trojan War saga, where she protected the city of Troy and the lovers Helen and Paris; her persecution of mortals who offended her, like Psyche and Hippolytus; the blessings given to believers like Pygmalion to live with their beloved; and her many love affairs, like Ares and Adonis.</p>
        <p>Aphrodite, along with Apollo, represents the ancient Greeks' ideal of beauty. She was constantly reproduced in the Arts, from Antiquity to the Contemporary Age, given the opportunity for artists to imagine a divine beauty. Today, her myth continues to exert influence on culture, and many strands of neo-paganism have returned to worship her.</p>

        <div id="container">
            <h2>The Judgment of Paris</h2>
            <img src="Aphrodite2.webp" alt="Aphrodite ">
            <p>Aphrodite's manipulative character is most apparent in the story of Helen, queen of Sparta, whom she offered as her bribe in the Judgment of Paris, inciting ten years of dreadful war at Troy.</p>
            <p>The Judgment was a popular subject in Pompeian wall painting, an example of which is shown here. The Trojan prince Paris, deep in thought, sits on a rock in front of the three goddesses, accompanied by the messenger god Hermes.</p>
            <p>Each goddess is clearly identifiable: Hera with her diadem and scepter; Athena with her armor; and standing proudly before them both, Aphrodite, unabashedly displaying her body to full effect.</p>
            <p>Paris chose Aphrodite, seduced by the prospect of Helen and her famed beauty. His elopement with the wife of Menelaos was the cause of the Trojan War.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="container">
            <h1><u>Relationship</u></h1>
            <img src="Aphrodite3.jpg" alt="Aphrodite">
            <p>The Tale of Aphrodite and Ares Ares wasn’t the only undesirable god among Zeus and Hera’s offspring. His brother Hephaestus was also rejected because of his terrible ugliness. As revenge, Hephaestus made a golden throne for Hera that wouldn’t allow her to get up until she met all of his demands. Among these demands were that Hephaestus be allowed back onto Mount Olympus and that he be given Aphrodite’s hand in marriage. This last demand caused extreme displeasure to Ares and Aphrodite, who had already fallen in love.</p>
            <p>Because they did not wish to give up the connection that had already been kindled between them, Ares and Aphrodite decided to continue their relationship in secret. This was fine for a time, but eventually Helios saw the two in an intimate embrace and told Hephaestus of the affair. Hephaestus was immediately angered and wanted revenge. Instead of confronting Ares directly, he made a net of the finest metals that he had. The end-product was a trap that was practically invisible and could be sprung by Hephaestus at any time he chose.</p>
            <p>Hephaestus waited until Ares and Aphrodite had engage in passionate lovemaking before he sprang his trap. The net shot up and trapped the two lovers in an intimate embrace that they couldn’t free themselves from. To make matters worse, Hephaestus invited all the gods and goddesses to his home to see the two lovers in their shameful state. The goddesses declined out of respect, but many of the gods went to marvel at Aphrodite’s beauty and cast shame upon Ares. The two were held in their revealing embrace for days before Hephaestus decided to let them go.</p>
            <p>Ares and Aphrodite never married, but there was a level of commitment that was shared between the two. Aphrodite went on to give birth to several children for Ares. Among these children were Phobos (god of fear and phobias), Deimos (god of terror), Harmonia (goddess of harmony), and Adrestia (goddess of revolt). Although it is not surprising that Ares was father to so many war gods and goddesses, it is also noted that he bore four other children with Aphrodite that were considerably more gentle in nature. These were the Erotes (the winged gods of love) and their names were Eros, Anteros, Himeros, and Pothos.</p>
